part 2: we updated the engine and built a new JavaFX desktop program with different Components that each one has it own FXML,css and logic.
it's important to say that we worked with Model-View-Controller (MVC) method.
and every one toke his own component to work on.

part 3: we updated the engine, 
1. now the engine holds few different gameManagers (games) simultaneously.
2. Events listener from type EventObject.(using for smart Ajax calls for html update)
3. Fix of bugs in the algorithm of the game.

we created client side with html,css,js(Jquery) and server side based on Servlets.
we created sharp and clean design with a mild animations.
the frontend framework was apache tomcat and chrome.
and the backend framework was IntelliJ Ultimate.

I hope you will enjoy it.
