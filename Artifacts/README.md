Hello welcome to the my project artifacts ,
quick guide how to run each part of the project. 
first of all, all the parts consumes the XML game files that I put in the 'XML check file' library. 
just pick the right XML. and choose option :
the XML files contains the initial properties of the game objects, kind of units, size of the board ect.. 
part1: ConsoleUI, just click on the ConsoleUI.bat and start to play. 
part2: JavaFXUI, just click on the JavaFX.bat and start to play. 
part3: startup tomcat server and load into the apache tomcat/webapps directory the WebUI.war file 
and then go to http://localhost:8080/WebUI/Pages/login.html address and start to play. 

then you will ask to load game / XML file. 
so just use the check files, that I told you about.
